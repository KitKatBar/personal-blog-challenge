# Personal Blog Challenge - Document Your Journey!

## Description

There are many social media websites that allow users to post content where everyone with Internet acess to the web can view it.  Some popular websites include Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.  Although all these websites do different things, the concept is ultimately the same: sharing content with people around the world.

With that being said, we are going to create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. The features of this blog will include building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle.  Once again, creating a website from scratch in a few days is no easy feat.  Even the companies mentioned above, who are basically titans in the industry, have a professional team of developers working around the clock to make their sites the best of the best.  However, no matter how small we see ourselves, we should still aspire to put in the effort and perform to the best of our ability to learn these skills.  Not even those companies started at the very top.  They worked their way up and so should we.

When you first load the webpage, you will be presented with the custom header and footer that I used in my previous professional portfolio project.  In the navigation bar will be an icon, which should be a moon icon since it is light-mode by default.  Clicking on the icon will transform the webpage into dark-mode, changing all the text colors and background colors to a more dark-themed display and replacing the icon with a sun icon.

In the body of the page you will see a blog icon and a form box.  Hovering over the blog icon will enlarge it slightly with a short animation, but this is only for aesthetic purposes.  The form box also changes color depending on the current mode of the webpage.  If you do not fill out all the fields in the form box, an error message will display for a few seconds then go away.  Filling out the form correctly will than take you to the blogpage.

In the blogpage, you will see your blog posted with the title, content and the user it was posted by.  The header and footer has the same design as the homepage.  Additionally, in the navigation bar, there is a back button which takes you back to the homepage when clicked.  I also reused the fancy hover animation for the 'back' button that I had previously used.  In the footer, there are additionally links to my social media websites.  I did not want to clutter it with too many links so I have only included links to my professional portfolio website (suitcase icon), GitHub and LinkedIn.

There is also an addition feature in the main content of the blogpage where the blogs are posted.  In the top right corner of each box, you will see an 'X' button that you can click to delete the blog.  The webpage will dynamically update by reloading and re-rendering the remaining blog posts.  If there are no blog posts, then there will be some text displayed encouraging the user to go back to the homepage and post something.

I believe those are all the features for now.  There are still some things I wanted to edit to make the website look more aesthetically pleasing so look out for that in the future when I do so!

Google Images for providing all the images and icons I needed to design my blogpage.

Our instructor Drew Hoang for once again giving us advice and his thought process on how to start creating a website from scratch.  It amazes me how he can look at a sample image or mock-up of a website and just be able to perfectly replicate it.  The fact that he is able to continuously do this again and again with the practice problems in class without affecting our ability to learn is amazing.  His speed-run videos are also very insightful for providing information and for reviewing class material.

Our TA Kyle Vance for his continued guidance during class and taking the time to explain how he would tackle practice problems.  He continues to provide direction for students and explains why he approaches these problems a certain way.  It gives us the confidence to try these tips on our own and we should have no fear even if we don't succeed because he's there to help us if we're ever stuck.
